## Problem 1

#### Load and tidy dataset:

``` r
#load and tidy dataset
birthweight = read_csv("./data/birthweight.csv") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  mutate(
    babysex = factor(recode(babysex, 
              `1` = "Male", 
              `2` = "Female")), 
    frace = factor(recode(frace, 
              `1` = "White", 
              `2` = "Black",
              `3` = "Asian", 
              `4` = "Puerto Rican", 
              `8` = "Other", 
              `9` = "Unknown")), 
    malform = factor(recode(malform, 
              `0` = "Absent", 
              `1` = "Present")), 
    mrace = factor(recode(mrace, 
              `1` = "White", 
              `2` = "Black",
              `3` = "Asian", 
              `4` = "Puerto Rican", 
              `8` = "Other"))) 
```

``` r
#check for missing values
anyNA(birthweight)
```

    ## [1] FALSE

#### Build a model:

Many factors, including biological and social, affect birthweight. Per
[March of
Dimes](https://www.marchofdimes.org/complications/low-birthweight.aspxl),
social factors that affect low birthweight include substances use, SES,
violence, and race. Using the variables available in the
`birthweight.csv` dataset, I hypothesize that family income, mother’s
race, and number of cigarettes smoked per day during pregnancy will be
significantly associated with birthweight.

First, I will test the bivariate associations between birthweight and
each covariate of interest. Covariates significant at p-value \<0.25
will be considered in the multinomial multivariable analysis.

##### Bivariate Analysis

``` r
bwt_model = birthweight %>% 
  mutate(
    mrace = fct_infreq(mrace)) %>% 
  select(bwt, fincome, gaweeks, mrace, smoken)

model_fincome = lm(bwt ~ fincome, data = bwt_model) %>% 
  broom::tidy() %>% 
  select(term, estimate, p.value) 
```

  - **Birthweight and Family Income:** At the 5% level of significant,
    family income is significantly associated with birthweight. For
    every $100 increase in monthly income, birthweight increases by 3.05
    grams.

<!-- end list -->

``` r
model_mrace = lm(bwt ~  mrace, data = bwt_model) %>% 
  broom::tidy() %>% 
  select(term, estimate, p.value) 
```

  - **Birthweight and Mother’s Race:** At the 5% level of significant,
    mother’s race is significantly associated with birthweight. Compared
    to white mothers, all other races have baby’s with a lower
    birthweight. Black mothers have baby’s who weigh -316.56 grams less.
    Puerto Rican mothers have baby’s who weigh -211.32 grams less. Asian
    mothers have baby’s who weigh -126.43 grams less.

<!-- end list -->

``` r
model_smoken = lm(bwt ~  smoken, data = bwt_model) %>% 
  broom::tidy() %>% 
  select(term, estimate, p.value)
```

  - **Birthweight and Smoking:** At the 5% level of significant, smoking
    is significantly associated with birthweight. For every 1 additional
    cigarette smoked per day, birthweight decreases -5.23 grams.

##### Multivariable Analysis

Now that we confirmed all three variables are separately and
significantly associated with the outcome (birthweight), we can move
forward with backwards step-wise analysis. I will fit a model with all
three variables. If one is not signifcant at a 5% alpha level, I will
remove that variable and repeat until all variables are significant.

``` r
model_social = lm(bwt ~ fincome + mrace + smoken, data = bwt_model) 

tidy_social = model_social %>% 
  broom::tidy() %>% 
  select(term, estimate, p.value) %>% 
  knitr::kable(digits = 3)

tidy_social
```

| term              |  estimate | p.value |
| :---------------- | --------: | ------: |
| (Intercept)       |  3293.000 |   0.000 |
| fincome           |     0.750 |   0.015 |
| mraceBlack        | \-343.160 |   0.000 |
| mracePuerto Rican | \-232.878 |   0.000 |
| mraceAsian        | \-177.071 |   0.018 |
| smoken            |  \-11.099 |   0.000 |

All three variables are significant at a 5% alpha level.

``` r
added_social = bwt_model %>% 
  modelr::add_residuals(model_social) %>% 
  modelr::add_predictions(model_social)

plot_social = added_social %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = pred, y = resid)) +
  geom_point()
```
