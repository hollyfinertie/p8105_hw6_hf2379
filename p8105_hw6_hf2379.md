## Problem 1

### a) Load and tidy dataset:

  - Confirmed no missing values
  - Converted race, malformation, and xex variables to factors
  - Converted variables with imperial units to metric

<!-- end list -->

``` r
birthweight = read_csv("./data/birthweight.csv") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  mutate(
    babysex = factor(recode(babysex, 
              `1` = "Male", 
              `2` = "Female")), 
    frace = factor(recode(frace, 
              `1` = "White", 
              `2` = "Black",
              `3` = "Asian", 
              `4` = "Puerto Rican", 
              `8` = "Other", 
              `9` = "Unknown")), 
    malform = factor(recode(malform, 
              `0` = "Absent", 
              `1` = "Present")), 
    mrace = factor(recode(mrace, 
              `1` = "White", 
              `2` = "Black",
              `3` = "Asian", 
              `4` = "Puerto Rican", 
              `8` = "Other")), 
    delwt = 453.592*delwt, 
    ppwt = 453.592*ppwt, 
    wtgain = 453.592*wtgain, 
    mheight = 2.54*mheight)
```

    ## Parsed with column specification:
    ## cols(
    ##   .default = col_double()
    ## )

    ## See spec(...) for full column specifications.

``` r
anyNA(birthweight)
```

    ## [1] FALSE

### b) Model Building:

Many factors, including biological and social, affect birthweight. Per
[March of
Dimes](https://www.marchofdimes.org/complications/low-birthweight.aspxl),
social factors that affect low birthweight include substance use, SES,
violence, and race. Using the variables available in the
`birthweight.csv` dataset, I hypothesize that family income, mother’s
race, and number of cigarettes smoked per day during pregnancy will be
significantly associated with birthweight in grams.

First, I will test the bivariate associations between birthweight and
each covariate of interest. Covariates significant at p-value \<0.25
will be considered in the multinomial multivariable analysis.

#### Bivariate Analysis

``` r
bwt_model = birthweight %>% 
  mutate(
    mrace = fct_infreq(mrace)) %>% 
  select(bwt, fincome, gaweeks, mrace, smoken)

model_fincome = lm(bwt ~ fincome, data = bwt_model) %>% 
  broom::tidy() %>% 
  select(term, estimate, p.value) 

model_fincome %>% knitr::kable(digits = 3)
```

| term        | estimate | p.value |
| :---------- | -------: | ------: |
| (Intercept) | 2979.987 |       0 |
| fincome     |    3.048 |       0 |

  - **Birthweight and Family Income:** At the specified 25% level of
    significant, family income is significantly associated with
    birthweight. For every $100 increase in monthly income, birthweight
    increases by 3.05 grams. This variable will be considered in the
    final model.

<!-- end list -->

``` r
model_mrace = lm(bwt ~  mrace, data = bwt_model) %>% 
  broom::tidy() %>% 
  select(term, estimate, p.value) 

model_mrace %>% knitr::kable(digits = 3)
```

| term              |  estimate | p.value |
| :---------------- | --------: | ------: |
| (Intercept)       |  3266.663 |   0.000 |
| mraceBlack        | \-316.564 |   0.000 |
| mracePuerto Rican | \-211.321 |   0.000 |
| mraceAsian        | \-126.430 |   0.093 |

  - **Birthweight and Mother’s Race:** At the specified 25% level of
    significant, mother’s race is significantly associated with
    birthweight. Compared to white mothers, all other races have baby’s
    with a lower birthweight. Black mothers have baby’s who weigh
    -316.56 grams less. Puerto Rican mothers have baby’s who weigh
    -211.32 grams less. Asian mothers have baby’s who weigh -126.43
    grams less. These indicator variables will be considered in the
    final model.

<!-- end list -->

``` r
model_smoken = lm(bwt ~  smoken, data = bwt_model) %>% 
  broom::tidy() %>% 
  select(term, estimate, p.value)

model_smoken %>% knitr::kable(digits = 3)
```

| term        | estimate | p.value |
| :---------- | -------: | ------: |
| (Intercept) | 3136.079 |       0 |
| smoken      |  \-5.229 |       0 |

  - **Birthweight and Smoking:** At the specified 25% level of
    significant, smoking is significantly associated with birthweight.
    For every 1 additional cigarette smoked per day, birthweight
    decreases -5.23 grams. This variable will be considered in the final
    model.

#### Multivariable Analysis

Now that we confirmed all three variables are separately and
significantly associated with the outcome (birthweight), we can move
forward with backwards step-wise analysis. I will fit a model with all
three variables. If one is not signifcant at a 5% alpha level, I will
remove that variable and repeat until all variables are significant.

``` r
model_social = lm(bwt ~ fincome + mrace + smoken, data = bwt_model) 

tidy_social = model_social %>% 
  broom::tidy() %>% 
  select(term, estimate, p.value) %>% 
  knitr::kable(digits = 3)

tidy_social
```

| term              |  estimate | p.value |
| :---------------- | --------: | ------: |
| (Intercept)       |  3293.000 |   0.000 |
| fincome           |     0.750 |   0.015 |
| mraceBlack        | \-343.160 |   0.000 |
| mracePuerto Rican | \-232.878 |   0.000 |
| mraceAsian        | \-177.071 |   0.018 |
| smoken            |  \-11.099 |   0.000 |

``` r
glanced_social = model_social %>% 
  broom::glance()
```

All three variables are significant at a 5% alpha level. Additionally,
the model describes 12% of the total variance in birthweight (R-squared
= 0.12). Using the reported F-statistic of 113.03 and p-value of 0, we
can conclude that this model fits the data better than a model with only
an intercept.

#### Model Residuals Against Fitted Values

``` r
added_social = bwt_model %>% 
  modelr::add_residuals(model_social) %>% 
  modelr::add_predictions(model_social)

added_social %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = pred, y = resid)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(
    title = "Plot of Residuals and Fitted Values"
  )
```

### c) Test Against Other Models:

Based on the below plot, the model with the interaction terms (`bwt =
bhead + blength + babysex + bhead x blength + bhead x babysex + blength
x babysex + bhead x blength x babysex`) is the best fitting model with
the lowest mean squared errors.

``` r
model_main_effects = lm(bwt ~ blength + gaweeks, data = birthweight) 

model_interaction = lm(bwt ~ bhead + blength + babysex 
                       + bhead*blength + bhead*babysex + blength*babysex
                       + bhead*blength*babysex, data = birthweight) 

bwt_cv = 
  crossv_mc(birthweight, 100) 

bwt_cv %>% pull(train) %>% .[[1]] %>% as_tibble
```

### Plots

**1) R-squared**  
The plot below shows the distribution of R-squared values. The 95%
confidence interval for R-squared is (0.89, 0.93). The distribution is
left skewed, with more outliers with lower values. Across the the 5,000
bootstraps, the mean R-squared value is 0.911 which is slightly lower
than the median 0.912 due to the skewness.

``` r
weather_bootstrap %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = r.squared)) + 
  geom_density() + 
  labs(
    title = "Distribution of R-squared Values"
  )
```

![](p8105_hw6_hf2379_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-10-1.png)<!-- -->

**2) Log(beta0 x beta1)**  
The plot below shows the distribution of log(beta0\* beta1) values. The
95% confidence interval for the log(beta0\*beta1) is (1.96, 2.06).
Visually, the distribution does not have any obvious skewness or
outliers and may follow a relatively normal distribution. Across the the
5,000 bootstraps, the mean value is 2.013 which is the same as the
median 2.013 indicating no skewness in the distribution.
